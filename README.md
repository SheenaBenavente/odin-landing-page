## Opportunities 🚧
Practice committing to git early and often as well as best practices for commit comments. While failure is not always easy, I'm hoping that learning through failure and repetition of basic commands will strengthen my foundation and eventually the little frustrations will be second nature. I LOT of opportunity to have a better understanding of flexbox.
